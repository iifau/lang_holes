# lang_holes
This repository contains code and files related to my coursework on topological language analysis.
## The adyghe texts
The original texts from Adyghe corpora (https://adyghe.web-corpora.net/) were sent to me in response to my request. The full texts are not avaliable online, and it is only possible to see sentences from them on the corpora website. I cannot share them either.
## The uniparser code
You can find the code used for parsing in this repository: https://github.com/ansorox/uniparser-grammar-adyghe. However, some changes were made in the scripts, for that reason, the files I used (with changes) will be uploaded here.
## How to use
### xml_to_txt.py
This is a script for making .txt-files on adyghe only out of .xml-files with both adyghe and non-adyghe texts.
Download the script, put your input files in a directory and write its name in the script, then run.
